// STACKS (push pop off the top (where 'top' is the end of the array))
// Stacks are special arrays where items can only be added and removed from the END
// This is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) procedure
// Javascript and Ruby use push() to add to the end of the stack and pop() to remove

// Practical applications from Stacks:
// Bracket Matching  (practice this?)
// Undo/redo operations
// Tower of Hanoi


QUEUES (standing in line at the bank)
Queues are another type of container, generally implemented with a linked list but 
can be implemented with arrays in Javascript and Ruby. Items are only added to the 
back of the queue --- push() --- and removed from the front --- shift() ---
FIFO (first in, first out) procedure

Practical applications for queues:
Representing a line
Buffers for print jobs, or other tasks
